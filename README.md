- Skip the onboarding procedure
- Download and install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)
- Download lovelace plugins from github

### Environment Variables

| Name | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `HASS_USERNAME` | The username of the default user | `dev` |
| `HASS_PASSWORD` | The password of the default user | `dev` |
| `LOVELACE_PLUGINS` | List of lovelac plugins to download from github | Empty |

### About Lovelace Plugins
The dowload and install of plugins is *very* basic. This is not HACS.

`LOVELACE_PLUGINS` should be a space separated list of author/repo pairs, e.g. `"thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod  kalkih/mini-media-player"`

`LOVELACE_LOCAL_FILES` is for the currently worked on plugins and should be a list of file names which are mounted in `/config/www/workspace`.

### Container Script

```bash
container
```
Set up and launch Home Assistant

```bash
container setup
```
Perform download and setup parts but do not launch Home Assistant

```bash
container launch
```
Launch Home Assistant with `hass -c /config -v`
